# Simple-Grayscale-Image-Manipulation
A collection of very simple image analysis and manipulation techniques for grayscale images

All files read a grayscale image `example.png`, and perform an operation on it.

## Task 1
Reads the example image and outputs the value of each pixel in `Grayscale.txt`

## Task 2
Reads the example image and quantizes it into 8 exact values based on predetermined thresholds. Output image is saved as `quantized.png`

## Task 3
Reads the example image and creates a 1D array histogram. The histogram is show in the console.
